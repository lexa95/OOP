Питон is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.

Питон supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library.

Питон interpreters are available for installation on many operating systems, allowing Питон code execution on a wide variety of systems. Using third-party tools, such as Py2exe or Pyinstaller,Питон code can be packaged into stand-alone executable programs for some of the most popular operating systems, allowing for the distribution of Питон-based software for use on those environments without requiring the installation of a Питон interpreter.

CПитон, the reference implementation of Питон, is free and open-source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its alternative implementations. CПитон is managed by the non-profit Питон Software Foundation.
